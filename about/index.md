Longdata was created as a Launchpad for IOT products. Our volunteer team of industry experts have developed a program to enable the maker community in the development of LoRaWAN products. With LoRaWAN gateways strategically located at the University of Akron and Case Western Reserve University, we can serve the local cottage industry of developers in Northern Ohio.

This team of industry experts has donated their time and expertise to guide developers in understanding and prototyping products with high volume deployment in mind. The maker community will have resources at a reasonable cost to prove their design with a quick prototype process. The canned training program process lends itself to a hackathon and multiple development competitions.
