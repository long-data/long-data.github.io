Our funding team is very active in the Maker community and as such has been instrumental in initiating funds for this project through the angel community. Just as we have volunteers to develop the program we have angels who have contributed to the program. The entities represented on this team are the University of Akron Research Foundation and think[box] from Case Western Reserve.
