The Gateway is the front end of the system. It receives the wireless data from
the LoRaWAN products and re-packetizes the data for the internet. We have a
number of volunteers on this team from Aclara RF (experience in RF deployment),
Bird Electronics (RF test equipment), and Embedded Planet (design and
manufacture of IOT Gateways). Their job has been to identify the site for
maximum coverage in each deployment.
