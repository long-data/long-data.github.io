Big data includes the Network Server and Application servers. The Network Server is hosted by Arrow Electronics and decides whether the LoRa
data is valid. If the data is valid the Network server packetizes the data and transfers it to the Application Server. The Application Server will either show the
data in the cloud or provide another service to close the process loop.
