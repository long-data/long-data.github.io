The training material will be posted soon as it is not yet tested. It will cover the four phases of the design process of LoRa based sensors.

- LoRa – This section of the training will cover LoRa and LoRaWAN as a technology. It will cover where LoRa fits into the IOT portfolio. It will also cover suggested applications and the current deployment strategy for North America.

- Arduino Development – This section of the training will cover the process used to load a sample program into the development board. It will also cover the additional sensor boards that can be used to modify the existing design.

- Provisioning – This section of the training will show the user how to connect the development board via LoRa to the network server and verify transmission.

- Cloud Hosting – This section of the training will cover what to do with the data in the cloud.
